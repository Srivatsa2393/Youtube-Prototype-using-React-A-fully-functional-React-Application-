In this project we are using the Youtube API's data no dummy data, 
it is a fully functional React Application. 
Initially I used the Redux Simple Starter Boilerplate to develop the application. 
The fully functional application consists of a search bar where a user can type in find the appropriate videos of his choice. 
The video will be displayed along with its title in the bottom and on to the right side we can see the list items. 
I have used the YTSearch for authentication. In the sample below  have hidden my API key please feel free to open your developer account in google ang fetch an API key and run the application.
